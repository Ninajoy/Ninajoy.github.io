    <h1>Growth Quest 2021 Nina</h1>
    <h4>Quests for a Front End Developer</h4>
    <p class="intro">When i grow up I want to be a good, kind & fun person to others and myself. I want to build bridges to connect people and pave my own roads. While solving puzzles and asking questions along the way. I want to work in an inclusive and diverse environment where people are treated equal, each talent is used optimally and where pay is equal too.

    Love is all & Keep on learning are my life motto's. So besides connection and courage i will keep on learning cool technical things. Kermit in itself (the design system with it's technical evolutions) is a great learning place. I will also keep on joining conferences and talks. And when there are interesting courses by for example Fronteers I will join those too.

      Oprah Winfrey wrote: "Great communication begins with <strong>connection</strong>. What makes us different from one another is so much less important than what makes us alike â€” we all long for acceptance and significance. When we recognize those needs in ourselves, we can better understand them in others, and that's when we can set aside our judgments and just hear." I believe that these sentences describe the journey i started in 2019 very accurately. To truly listen allows me to see the world from other people's perspectives, to understand them better and to help create better solutions for our ways of working. It removes the imaginative border between us and them; it <strong>connects</strong>. My search for connection will be based on the following values which i think are of high importance: trust, equality and compassion.
      <ul>
        <strong>Stay Connected</strong>
        <li>Keep on drinking coffees with inspiring people & mentors</li>
        <li>Continue with the Front-End Guild</li>
        <li>Setup Front-End alignment for CM & stay aligned with BM</li>
        <li>Keep Kermit connect ed through labs & other connecting initiatives</li>
      </ul>

      2020 was terribly beautiful. It was the year I learned to surf on the waves of uncertainty. It was a year filled with growth. December came and I realised I got less insecure and more aware of my own courage. Because even though I find a lot of things very scary. I will do them. Presenting Front-End Guilds? Scary, but I will do it. Asking questions and speak up? Scary, but I will do it. Asking for help? Scary, but I will do it. Courage and strength to break down my wall to discover and be my best self every day! And to connect the silo's within our company.
      <ul>
        <strong>Courage</strong>
        <li>Share knowledge, innovations, failures and successes.</li>
        <li>Get better at asking questions by learning more about practical philosophy.
        </li>
      </ul>
