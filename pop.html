What makes us different from one another is so much less important than what makes us alike â€” we all long for acceptance and significance. When we recognize those needs in ourselves, we can better understand them in others, and that's when we can set aside our judgments and just hear." I believe that these sentences describe the journey i started last year very accurately. To truly listen allows me to see the world from other people's perspectives, to understand them better and to help create better solutions for our ways of working. It removes the imaginative border between us and them; it <strong>connects</strong>. My search for connection will be based on the following values which i think are of high importance: trust, equality and compassion.
      <ul>
        <strong>How to connect</strong>
        <li>Drink coffee every week with a collegue from KPN (other developers,busines,leap team), to listen to them and maybe a good idea comes out of it which improves our way of working</li>
        <li>Learn more about leap and how i can participate</li>
        <li>Start/join events which help to connect</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>The only constant in life is change.</strong>  I want that change in my life to be renewal and <strong>innovation</strong> I want to keep growing towards the best version I can be. I believe that the following list will help me
      innovate myself and the company I work for.
      <ul>
        <strong>How to keep on innovating</strong>
        <li>Get certified: Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification @FreeCodeCamp
        </li>
        <li>Get updated: Visit Front End congresses to learn about new developments and read FE newssites every week</li>
        <li>Share knowledge, innovations, failures and successes: Share Front End Congress highlights with colleagues.
          And maybe inform the business about FE innovations in the future?</li>
        <li>Participate in innovations: Participate in innovative projects (within the team) & update my Tshape with
          Unit Testing, Accessibility & Security skills</li>
      </ul>
