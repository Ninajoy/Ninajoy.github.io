			In november 2018 i fell into a <strong>depression</strong>. I was numbed, anxious, had an immense lack of
			selfworth and could not stop crying. It was hard. Acceptance from myself and others were one of the keys to
			start
			my <strong>recovery</strong>. The other keys were all my own to find and use: Going to a psychologist,
			starting
			medication, keeping to a daily rhythm, mindfullness, yoga and hapto therapy. I am still recovering with the
			help
			of all these keys and it is my goal to be fully recovered in 2019.

			<strong>The only constant in life is change.</strong> I want that change in my life to be renewal and
			<strong>innovation</strong> I want to keep growing towards the best version I can be. I believe that the
			following technical and social skills will help me
			innovate myself and the company I work for.
			<ul>
				<strong>Technical skills:</strong>
				<li>Get certified: Responisve webdesign & Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification
					@FreeCodeCamp
				</li>
				<li>Get updated: Visit Front End congresses to learn about new developments and read FE newssites very
					week</li>
				<li>Participate in innovations: Participate in innovative projects (within the team) & update my Tshape
					with
					Unit Testing, Accessibility & Security skills</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<strong>Personal skills:</strong>
				<li>Learn to express myself better: i find it hard to express what i feel and think and to find the
					right words
					to clarify them: i think this is the basis for my longing to be heard, combined with listening
					skills. Youtube
					and a course could help with that.</li>
				<li>Share knowledge, innovations, failures and successes: Share Front End Congress highlights with
					colleagues.
					And maybe inform the business about FE innovations in the future?</li>
			</ul>
